"""Titans-style neural memory (arXiv:2501.00663, "Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time").

The memory is the fast weights of a small MLP, one copy per sample. `write` performs one step of
online gradient descent with momentum and forgetting on the associative loss ||M(k) - v||^2
(paper eqs. 11-14), where the key/value/query projections of the current hidden tokens are
    k = L2Norm(SiLU(x W_K)),  q = L2Norm(SiLU(x W_Q)),  v = L2Norm(SiLU(x W_V));
`read` runs the MLP on the query without updating (eq. 15). Keys, queries, and values are all
unit-norm, so both the memory MLP's input scale and the regression-target scale are pinned
regardless of the incoming hidden-state scale: a fresh memory's surprise is exactly 1.0 and
falls toward 0 as content becomes recalled. (Without the value norm, the write budget is spent
on the generic mean component of the targets and nothing frame-specific is stored -- measured.)

There are two disjoint parameter sets:
  * outer (regular nnx params, trained by backprop through writes): W_K / W_V / W_Q, the gate
    head producing (theta, eta, alpha), and the initial fast weights `m0`;
  * inner (`MemoryState`): the per-sample fast weights and their momentum, updated only by
    `write` -- never by the optimizer.

All inner math is float32.

v3.4 additions (V34_PLAN_final.md):
  * Explicit key-space core API (plan 5.10): `project_kv` / `project_q` / `read_key` /
    `write_kv`. The public `read`/`write` are thin wrappers (projection + gates + core), so
    own-key recall, auxiliary-query reads, and synthetic Stage-0 batteries hit exact code
    boundaries instead of double-projecting through the hidden-space interface.
  * `mlp_l2norm` (plan 5.7): unit-L2 normalization of the memory-MLP input and every hidden
    activation (`h_0 = L2Norm(k)`, `h_{l+1} = L2Norm(SiLU(W_l h_l))`, output layer untouched).
    Pins activations O(1) so raw inner gradients are O(1) and the per-write clip stops
    saturating -- the v3.3 replay measured EVERY write saturated (min 3x over the clip, median
    ~500x, worst ~20M x) which made writes constant-size and bloated the fast weights
    exponentially within an episode. With normalization, layer 0 switches from std-1.0 init to
    He (the std-1 compensated lecun shrinkage, which normalization makes moot).
  * `write_kv(..., zero_gradient=True)` / `decay_step` (plan 8.4): the "Dynamics-only"
    retention control -- S_t = eta S_{t-1}, M_t = (1-alpha) M_{t-1} + S_t with the gradient
    term zeroed, isolating passive momentum/forgetting dynamics from new-write interference.
  * Optional drift trust region (`drift_radius`): if ||fast_weights - m0|| exceeds R the drift
    is rescaled to R, direction preserved. A bloat guardrail that does not touch retention.
  * `token_write_diagnostics` is rebuilt on per-token autodiff (plan 5.7): the previous
    analytic backprop hard-coded SiLU-only layers and would silently misreport every
    per-token gradient once L2Norm layers exist. `jax.grad`, one token at a time, stays
    correct under any future MLP change (validated against direct `jax.grad` in tests).

v3.5 Revision-4 opt-in branch:
  * ``delta_output/pooled_frame`` reduces each frame to one normalized association, decays only
    the output matrix, and applies a differentiable direct rank-one residual assignment.
  * Hidden fast leaves remain fixed; output bias and all momentum remain exact zero. Fixed-alpha
    write-free gaps can therefore be collapsed analytically without changing forward dynamics.
  * Pooling, hidden features, fast state, commits, analytic decay, and raw reads stay FP32.
